set ops:
	union - combines from both sets
		set1.union(set2)  or   set1 | set2    
	intersection - only what overlaps betwen sets
		set1.intersection(set2)   or    set1 & set2
	difference - that things that are in the first set that arent in the second
		set1.difference(set2)  or set1 - set2
	symmetric - everything that doesnt overlap between the two
		set1.symmetric_differnece(set2)     or set1 ^ set2

Subsets and Supersets:
	supssetood - set1.issubset(set2) or s1 <= s2
		vice versa for superset (.issuperset()) or >=
		this means they can also be equal
	proper subsethood s1 < s2 or supersethood s1 > s2
	inspace operations are the same with _update after the thing
	

dijointness and quality:
	disjoint: two sets are completelty opposite
	s1.isdisjoint(s2)
	quality: is the same excactly
	s1 == s2
	
len(set) - tells size

ITEM in SET - shows if item is in set or not
ITEM not in SET  

SET.remove(ITEM) - removes items
SET.discard(ITEM)
SET.pop(ITEM) 

pets = forzensets({INSERT SET}) - CREATES FROZEN SET
operations can be used btween the sets 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

comaring things:
	numerbers are as you thing
	Tru > False
	in a ordered sequences, evals the first item compared to the same item (one position at a time) in the other list, then second if first matches - the longer list in all matching is greater than (same for strings, and tuples
	strings are compared based on unicode
		duck < fish
		Horse < bird - upper case lettter are less in unicode
		moose < a(w accent)lg bc accented character are more
		english < other languages

sorting:
	COLLECTION.sort() - list in place - setting equal to a value returns none
	sorted(COLLECTION) - sorts colelction and returns new list - can do dict
	sorted(COLLECTION, reverse=TRUE) - sorts in descending order
	COLLECTION.sort(key=len) - sorts collection based of len based on defined criteria
	variable = sort(DICT, key=DICT.get) - sorts the objects based on values
